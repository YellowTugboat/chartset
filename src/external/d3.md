D3 is considered an overall external dependency. Monte is tested against a full D3 build, but not
all subpackages are required. Below is a best estimate to list the true D3 subpackage dependencies.

Custom builds should include (and their dependencies and devDependencies as of November 21st, 2016):
* d3-axis (d3-scale)
* d3-dispatch (no D3 dependencies)
* d3-ease (no D3 dependencies)
* d3-scale (d3-array, d3-collection, d3-color, d3-format, d3-interpolate, d3-time, and d3-time-format)
* d3-selection (no D3 dependencies)
* d3-shape (d3-path, d3-polygon)
* d3-transition (d3-color, d3-dispatch, d3-ease, d3-interpolate, d3-selection, d3-timer)

Unused, but potential roadmap use:
* d3-brush (No brush support in Monte yet)
* d3-drag (No drag support in Monte yet)
* d3-force (No force features in Monte)
* d3-geo (No geographic support in Monte yet)
* d3-hierarchy (No tree chart types in Monte yet)
* d3-quadtree (No brush support in Monte yet)
* d3-voronoi (No Voronoi support in Monte yet)
* d3-zoom (No zoom support in Monte yet)

Unused and unlikely for inclusion:
* d3-dsv (No direct data format conversion in Monte)
* d3-request (No direct data loading in Monte)
* d3-queue (No queuing needed in Monte)
